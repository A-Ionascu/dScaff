Scaffolding strategy for draft assembled contigs based on reference genes annotations

<div align="justify">

#
#
### Strategy:

Digital Scaffolding (**dScaff**) aims improve new draft assemblies of organisms that have a better reference assebly in with annotated genes in various databases. This strategy is most valuable when performing *de novo* assemblies of local species. The inplemented strategy aims to use the draft assembly, sequences of all genes from the reference genome and a table of their annotation in order to enhance scaffolding posibilities.
